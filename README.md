Assignment 5

Description This project was made in Java with IntelliJ Idea. This project was writed to laboratory in my University. I guess that this project will see only my teacher, but this README is still important. I had 10 problems, in this code i have an 11 files (10 classes for each problem and main)

Contributing There may some bugs, but it also solving all this problems. I call the functions by main, without getter and setter(1-4 except). I call each method from main file, for easier code. In the code i also writed some comments to explaination.
